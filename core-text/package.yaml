synopsis: A text type based on a finger tree over UTF-8 fragments
description: |
  A data type for text, built as a finger tree over UTF-8 text fragments.
  
  The main type and its usage are described at "Core.Text.Rope" in this
  package.
  
  This is part of a library intended to ease interoperability and assist in
  building command-line programs, both tools and longer-running daemons.
  A list of features and some background to the library's design is contained
  in the
  <https://github.com/oprdyn/unbeliever/blob/master/README.markdown README>
