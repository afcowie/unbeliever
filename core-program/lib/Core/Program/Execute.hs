Embelish a Haskell command-line program with useful behaviours.

/Runtime/

Sets number of capabilities (heavy-weight operating system threads used by
the GHC runtime to run Haskell green threads) to the number of CPU cores
available (for some reason the default is 1 capability only, which is a bit
silly on a multicore system).

Install signal handlers to properly terminate the program performing
cleanup as necessary.

Encoding is set to UTF-8, working around confusing bugs that sometimes
occur when applications are running in Docker containers.

/Logging and output/

The 'Program' monad provides functions for both normal output and debug
logging. A common annoyance when building command line tools and daemons is
getting program output to @stdout@ and debug messages interleaved, made
even worse when error messages written to @stderr@ land in the same
console. To avoid this, when all output is sent through a single channel.
This includes both normal output and log messages.

/Exceptions/

Ideally your code should handle (and not leak) exceptions, as is good
practice anywhere in the Haskell ecosystem. As a measure of last resort
however, if an exception is thrown (and not caught) by your program it will
be caught at the outer 'execute' entrypoint, logged for debugging, and then
your program will exit.

/Customizing the execution context/

The 'execute' function will run your 'Program' in a basic 'Context'
initialized with appropriate defaults. Most settings can be changed at
runtime, but to specify the allowed command-line options and expected
arguments you can initialize your program using 'configure' and then run
with 'executeWith'.

between threads

Retrieve the values of parameters parsed from options and arguments
supplied by the user on the command-line.

The command-line parameters are returned in a 'Map', mapping from from the
option or argument name to the supplied value. You can query this map
directly:

@
program = do
    params <- 'getCommandLine'
    let result = 'lookupKeyValue' \"silence\" (paramterValuesFrom params)
    case result of
        'Nothing' -> 'return' ()
        'Just' quiet = case quiet of
            'Value' _ -> 'throw' NotQuiteRight               -- complain that flag doesn't take value
            'Empty'   -> 'write' \"You should be quiet now\"   -- much better
    ...
@

which is pattern matching to answer "was this option specified by the
user?" or "what was the value of this [mandatory] argument?", and then "if
so, did the parameter have a value?"

This is available should you need to differentiate between a @Value@ and an
@Empty@ 'ParameterValue', but for many cases as a convenience you can use
the 'lookupOptionFlag', 'lookupOptionValue', and 'lookupArgument' functions
below (which are just wrappers around a code block like the example shown
here).

Arguments are mandatory, so by the time your program is running a value
has already been identified. This returns the value for that parameter.
